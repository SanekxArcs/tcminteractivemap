# Dev Mode Guide — TCM Interactive Map

## Enabling dev mode

Add `?dev` to the URL:

```
http://localhost:5173/?dev
```

This mounts the **Dev Panel** in the top-right corner of the map. It only exists in dev mode — it's never shown to regular visitors.

## The panel

- **⚙ Dev — Coordinate Picker** header, with a **?** button (opens this guide) and a **▲/▼** button to minimize/expand the panel.
- **"Click adds:"** — choose the point type *before* clicking the map. Every click after that drops a new point of that type at the clicked coordinate.
- Each point shows up two places at once: as a row in the panel list, and as a colored, numbered pin on the map itself.
- **Drag a pin** on the map to nudge its position — the panel list (and the coordinates in the copied JSON) update to match. No need to delete and re-click to fix placement.
- **✕** on a row removes that point.
- **Clear** wipes the whole list.
- The list is saved to your browser's local storage, so refreshing the page or Vite hot-reloading doesn't lose your work. Use **Clear** once you've copied everything out.

## Point types and their fields

Each type maps to a specific file/array in `public/`. Types with extra fields have a **▸ fields** toggle on their row to expand a small form.

### Event
→ `events` array in `public/data/playlists/{id}.json`
Fields: name, number (e.g. `1/9`), type (Race, Outrun, …), weather (type-in with suggestions), car, category, xp, bucks.

### Feat
→ `feats` array in the same playlist file
Fields: type — dropdown of `speedtrap` / `slalom` / `escape` / `drift` / `long_jump` / `bullseye` / `buoy_smashing` (this also drives the `featType` label, filled in automatically), location, objective, xp, bucks.

### Photo Op
→ `photoOps` array
Fields: name, requirements — type one requirement per line; exported as a JSON array.

### Collectible
→ `collectibles` array
Fields: challenge only. (Collectibles don't have their own `name` field in the data.)

### Container
→ the single `container` object per playlist (not an array)
No extra fields — just the coordinate.

### Misc
→ `public/data/misc.json`
Generic name-only capture. `misc.json` actually has 5 differently-shaped groups (`mf_grounds`, `demo_royale`, `grand_race`, `achievements`, `treasure`), so you'll need to hand-adjust the copied JSON to fit whichever group you're adding to.

### Challenge
→ `public/challenges.json`
Fields: name, plus an icon dropdown (Start / Finish / Challenge) in place of the type badge.

### Region
→ `public/data/regions.json`
Fields: name only.

### Rival
→ `public/data/rivals.json`
Fields:
- **Gang Group** — free text with suggestions (`clawblades`, `diamond_fangs`, `quickwhiskers`, `nightstalkers`, `chiefs`, `mysterious_driver`). This tells you which top-level key in `rivals.json` to paste the entry under — it's exported as a `group` field in the copied JSON as a hint, but that key doesn't exist in the real file, so delete it once you've sorted the entry into place.
- **Gang (display)** — auto-fills based on the group you typed, but stays editable. This is the actual `gang` value written into the file (chiefs, for example, keep their original gang's name here rather than "Chiefs").
- rivalCar, chaseRestriction, raceRestriction.

## Copying data out

- **Copy JSON** copies every point currently in the list as one array, each already shaped to match its own type.
- The preview pane at the bottom of the panel always shows exactly what will be copied.
- If you mix multiple types in one session (e.g. events and feats), the array will contain differently-shaped objects — split them into their respective files by hand.

## Tips

- Zoom in before placing points — precision matters, and the base map image is large.
- Pins are colored by type (same colors used for search-result badges), so a busy cluster stays readable.
- Toggle sidebar layers on/off while in dev mode to see existing markers for context before adding new ones nearby.
